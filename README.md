# 👋 Hey, I'm David

## 🪖 Veteran Software Engineer | Military Veteran | Fallout-Zone Builder

**Veteran software engineer with 20+ years building enterprise-grade solutions.**
Former military professional turned problem-solver — designing systems that stay online when everything else is on fire.

🪖 Service Record

- 🪖 21+ years military service
- 💻 20+ years engineering experience
- ⚙️ Enterprise & mission-critical systems
- 🧨 Automation, APIs, integrations
- 🎮 Live system testing via Twitch

> *Welcome to the fallout zone. Reliability is not optional.*

## 🧠 Mission Brief

* Build **enterprise & mission-critical systems** that survive real-world abuse
* Engineer **automation, APIs, integrations, and tooling**
* Design **scalable, resilient architectures** under pressure
* Reduce chaos through clean code, discipline, and repeatable processes

I work best where stakes are high, requirements are messy, and failure isn’t acceptable.

## 🎖 Background

Before engineering software, I served in the **military**, where discipline, execution, and operating under pressure were non-negotiable. That mindset carries forward into everything I build today:

* Plan deliberately
* Execute cleanly
* Ship systems that hold the line when things go sideways

## 🎮 Broadcasting From the Fallout Zone

Part-time streamer focused on:

* Live problem-solving
* Building automation on-stream
* Stress-testing systems in controlled chaos

📡 **Twitch:** [https://twitch.tv/SimmyDizzle](https://twitch.tv/SimmyDizzle)

Streaming keeps my skills sharp and my solutions honest.
