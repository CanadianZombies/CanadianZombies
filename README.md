# 👋 Hey, I'm David

## Veteran Software Engineer | Military Veteran | Builder

Veteran software engineer with 20+ years of experience building enterprise-grade solutions. Former military professional turned problem-solver, specializing in scalable systems, automation, and reliability under pressure.

## 🧠 What I Do

* Design and build **enterprise and mission-critical systems**
* Specialize in **automation, APIs, integrations, and tooling**
* Focus on **scalable, resilient architectures** that survive real-world abuse
* Turn complex problems into simple, maintainable solutions

I enjoy working where systems, people, and chaos intersect — especially when reliability actually matters.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**

* C# / .NET
* Python
* JavaScript

**Systems & Tooling**

* API design & integration
* Automation pipelines
* Webhooks & event-driven systems
* OBS / Streamer.bot integrations

**Platforms**

* Windows
* Linux
* Cloud & on-prem environments

## 🎖 Background

Before software engineering, I served in the **military**, where discipline, execution, and working under pressure were non-negotiable. That mindset still drives how I approach engineering today: plan carefully, build deliberately, and ship solutions that hold up when things go sideways.

## 🎮 Streaming & Side Projects

Part-time streamer focused on:

* Live problem-solving
* Building automation on-stream
* Breaking systems (safely) and rebuilding them better

Streaming keeps my skills sharp and my solutions honest.

---

## 🤝 Open To

* Open-source collaboration
* Interesting automation or systems projects
* Knowledge-sharing with other engineers

If you like clean solutions, controlled chaos, and shipping real things — we’ll probably get along.
